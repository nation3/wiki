# Guilds

Nation3 is a decentralized project, without a leader or a centralized team.
Therefore it relies on the concept of guilds — small groups of people organizing to perform work.

There are currently a few formed guilds, but the most active are:

- **Meta Guild**: Organizes and performs key meta-work for Nation3 to work. Some of the most active members of the Meta Guild have formed a multisig which is quite relevant inside the ecosystem, being used by the DAO to delegate certain functions.
- **Developers Guild**: Maintains some key pieces of infrastructure inside Nation3.

To become part of a guild and discover other guilds, [join Discord](https://discord.gg/nation3).
